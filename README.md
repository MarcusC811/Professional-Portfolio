## Marcus Carlough's Professional Portfolio

Hello all! Thanks for stopping by my portfolio page. This website is pretty simple in that it is just a reference for my work that I have done, however there is are some responsive elements to the page that you are welcome to checkout! Instructions below!

## Responsive Layout Instructions

## Step 1:

Right click anywhere on the screen and click on the word "Inspect"

## Step 2

Once in the DevTool window, click the phone icon at the top left

## Step 3

Now you use slide adjuster to modify the width of the webpage and see how to the elements on the page react to being shrunk
